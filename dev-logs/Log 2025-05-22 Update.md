  - ChildSelector: For switching between children
  - TaskForm: For creating new tasks
  - ProgressBar: For displaying completion percentage
- Created utility functions for task icons and progress calculation
- Implemented a simple reactive store for task state management

### Testing Implementation
- Set up Vitest for testing framework
- Created comprehensive test suite:
  - Component tests for UI elements
  - Unit tests for utility functions
  - Integration tests for dashboard functionality
- Focused on thorough testing of major functionality

## Architecture Decisions

### Component Structure
- Followed single-responsibility principle for components
- Used props down, events up pattern for component communication
- Kept template, script, and style sections organized within Vue components

### State Management
- Implemented a lightweight store solution for managing tasks
- Avoided unnecessary complexity by using Vue's reactivity system

### Testing Strategy
- Focus on testing behavior rather than implementation details
- Used component isolation for unit tests
- Used mocks for child components in integration tests

## Next Steps
- Implement data persistence using a backend service
- Add authentication to secure parent and child views
- Enhance user experience with animations and transitions
- Add support for multiple families and user accounts
