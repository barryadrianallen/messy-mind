# Project Status Log - Messy Mind - 2025-05-25

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Messy Mind
- **Type:** Mobile-First Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Goal:** To provide a structured, sensory-considerate, and user-friendly task management tool for families with neurodivergent members. Enables parents to assign/monitor tasks and children to engage with routines clearly.
- **Tech Stack:** Nuxt 3 (Vue.js), Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (NO TypeScript), Vue composables for state management, local JSON for mock data.
- **Testing:** Vitest with Vue Test Utils.

## 2. Key Features Implemented
- Secure Parent/Child login flows.
- **Parent Dashboard:**
    - Child selection.
    - Task management (add, complete/incomplete, delete - basic functionality).
    - Navigation to Family Settings.
- **Child Dashboard:**
    - Displays assigned tasks.
    - Allows toggling task completion.
    - Progress bar for task visualization.
- **Family Settings Page (`/family-settings`):**
    - **Family Members Tab:**
        - Lists family members (`FamilyMemberItem.vue`).
        - "Add Member" functionality via `AddMemberModal.vue` (handles Parent/Child roles, conditional age field for Child).
        - Local reactive list for members.
        - Dynamic "Family Statistics" section (placeholder).
    - **Themes Tab:**
        - Displays selectable theme cards.
        - UI updates to indicate selected theme (site-wide application pending).
        - Supports deep linking to tabs (e.g., `?tab=themes`).
- **Component Library:** Various reusable UI components (e.g., `DashboardHeader`, `ProgressBar`, `ChildTaskItem`, `FamilyMemberItem`, `AddMemberModal`).

## 3. Recent Developments (Session of 2025-05-25)
- **Enhanced Testing Suite:**
    - Added comprehensive tests for `AddMemberModal.vue`.
    - Fixed various minor issues in existing tests for `AddMemberModal.test.js` and `FamilyMemberItem.test.js`.
    - Suppressed an expected Vue console warning in `FamilyMemberItem.test.js` related to testing default prop factory behavior.
- **UI/UX Refinements:**
    - `FamilyMemberItem.vue`: Conditionally displays "Age" information only for 'Child' roles, enhancing clarity for 'Parent' profiles.
    - `ChildTaskItem.vue`: Removed task icons to improve visual consistency across the task list. This change was propagated to `ChildDashboard.vue`.
- **Code Refactoring:**
    - `ChildDashboard.vue`: Externalized initial mock data (child name and task list) to `data/mockChildDashboardData.js` for better organization and maintainability.
- **Test Status:** All 68 tests are currently passing.

## 4. Current State & Next Steps
- The core UI for parent and child task management is in place.
- Family member management and theme selection UIs are functional at a basic level.
- The testing suite has been significantly improved and is stable.

**Potential Next Steps:**
- **Data Persistence:** Transition from local mock data/state to a more robust solution (e.g., Vuex/Pinia for global state, or initial integration with Supabase if planned).
- **Family Settings - Full Functionality:**
    - Implement actual edit/delete functionality for family members.
    - Implement site-wide theme application based on selection in Family Settings.
- **Task Management Enhancements:**
    - More detailed task creation options (e.g., due dates, recurrence, points/rewards).
    - Filtering/sorting tasks.
- **Parent Dashboard - Advanced Features:**
    - Overview of all children's progress.
    - Notifications or alerts.
- **Error Handling & Edge Cases:** Review components and flows for robust error handling.
- **Accessibility (A11y) Review:** Ensure all components and interactions meet accessibility standards.
- **Further Refactoring:**
    - Review components for any further low-risk refactoring opportunities (e.g., composables for shared logic).
    - Ensure consistent coding patterns and styles across the project.

## 5. Known Issues/Warnings
- None critical. The previous Vue warning regarding missing props in `FamilyMemberItem.test.js` has been addressed by suppressing it for the specific test case.

This log provides a snapshot of the project's status for ongoing development.
