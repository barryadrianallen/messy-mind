# Project Status Log - Messy Mind - 2025-05-25

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Messy Mind
- **Type:** Mobile-First Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Goal:** To provide a structured, sensory-considerate, and user-friendly task management tool for families with neurodivergent members. Enables parents to assign/monitor tasks and children to engage with routines clearly.
- **Tech Stack:** Nuxt 3 (Vue.js), Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (NO TypeScript), Vue composables for state management, local JSON for mock data.
- **Testing:** Vitest with Vue Test Utils.

## 2. Key Features Implemented
- Secure Parent/Child login flows.
- **Parent Dashboard:**
    - Child selection.
    - Task management (add, complete/incomplete, delete - basic functionality).
    - Navigation to Family Settings.
- **Child Dashboard:**
    - Displays assigned tasks.
    - Allows toggling task completion.
    - Progress bar for task visualization.
- **Family Settings Page (`/family-settings`):**
    - **Family Members Tab:**
        - Lists family members (`FamilyMemberItem.vue`).
        - "Add Member" functionality via `AddMemberModal.vue` (handles Parent/Child roles, conditional age field for Child).
        - Local reactive list for members.
        - Dynamic "Family Statistics" section (placeholder).
    - **Themes Tab:**
        - Displays selectable theme cards.
        - UI updates to indicate selected theme (site-wide application pending).
        - Supports deep linking to tabs (e.g., `?tab=themes`).
- **Component Library:** Various reusable UI components (e.g., `DashboardHeader`, `ProgressBar`, `ChildTaskItem`, `FamilyMemberItem`, `AddMemberModal`).

## 3. Recent Developments (Session of 2025-05-25)
- **Enhanced Testing Suite:**
    - Added comprehensive tests for `AddMemberModal.vue`.
    - Fixed various minor issues in existing tests for `AddMemberModal.test.js` and `FamilyMemberItem.test.js`.
    - Suppressed an expected Vue console warning in `FamilyMemberItem.test.js` related to testing default prop factory behavior.
- **UI/UX Refinements:**
    - `FamilyMemberItem.vue`: Conditionally displays "Age" information only for 'Child' roles, enhancing clarity for 'Parent' profiles.
    - `ChildTaskItem.vue`: Removed task icons to improve visual consistency across the task list. This change was propagated to `ChildDashboard.vue`.
- **Code Refactoring:**
    - `ChildDashboard.vue`: Externalized initial mock data (child name and task list) to `data/mockChildDashboardData.js` for better organization and maintainability.
- **Family Settings Testing & Routing Refactor:**
    - **Test Fixes (`family-settings.test.js`):**
        - Resolved `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'query')` by correctly mocking `$route` in test setup.
        - Addressed `Cannot call trigger on an empty DOMWrapper` errors by:
            - Adding `data-testid` attributes to interactive elements in `FamilySettings.vue` (toggle advanced options button, delete family button, danger zone container) for reliable selection.
            - Updating test selectors to use these `data-testid` attributes.
        - Mocked `window.alert` to suppress "Not implemented" errors from jsdom during tests, resulting in cleaner test output.
    - **Dashboard Routing Refactor:**
        - Renamed `pages/parent.vue` to `pages/parent-dashboard.vue`.
        - Renamed `pages/child.vue` to `pages/child-dashboard.vue`.
        - Updated `pages/login.vue` to use `navigateTo` for routing to the new `/parent-dashboard` and `/child-dashboard` paths.
        - Removed unused `useRouter` import from `login.vue`.
    - **Test Status:** All 74 tests are now passing.

### Supabase Authentication Integration (New)

- **Parent Signup Flow:**
    - Successfully implemented parent signup using email and password via `pages/login.vue`.
    - Integrated Supabase client (`$supabase.auth.signUp` accessed via `useNuxtApp()`).
    - User data (`full_name`, `username`, `role='parent'`) is passed in `options.data` during signup. This data is used by the `handle_new_user` SQL trigger function to populate the `public.profiles` table from `NEW.raw_user_meta_data`.
    - Resolved database error (`CHECK constraint violation` on `role` column) during signup by ensuring the `role` value sent from the frontend ('parent') matches the allowed values in the `profiles` table.
- **Email Confirmation:**
    - Email confirmation is active (configured via `enable_confirmations = true` in `supabase/config.toml` for local dev and Supabase project settings). Users receive a confirmation email upon signup.
    - Resolved 404 error after clicking the confirmation link:
        - The `site_url` in `supabase/config.toml` (`http://localhost:3000`) is used as the base for the confirmation redirect.
        - Created `pages/index.vue` which now redirects users from the root (`/`) to `/login`. This handles the default Supabase redirect after email confirmation.
    - Replaced the `alert()` after signup with a dedicated page (`pages/please-confirm.vue`) instructing users to check their email, improving UX. Navigation to this page is handled in `pages/login.vue`.
- **Parent Login Flow:**
    - Parent login with email and password is functional in `pages/login.vue` using `$supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`.
    - Users are redirected to `/parent-dashboard` upon successful login.
- **Supabase Client Initialization & Configuration:**
    - Supabase client is initialized via a Nuxt plugin: `plugins/supabase.client.js`.
    - The client instance is available globally in Vue components as `$supabase` (accessed via `const { $supabase } = useNuxtApp();`).
    - This plugin uses `useRuntimeConfig()` to fetch `NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from the `.env` file.
    - The old `utils/supabase.js` file was removed.
    - Local Supabase services (Docker) are configured via `supabase/config.toml`. Key settings touched: `[auth] site_url`, `[auth.email] enable_confirmations, enable_signup`.
- **Database Schema (`public.profiles`):**
    - The `profiles` table is linked to `auth.users` via a foreign key (`id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`).
    - It includes columns for `full_name`, `username` (unique), and `role` (with a `CHECK` constraint for 'parent' or 'child').
    - Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled, with policies allowing users to read/update their own profiles.
    - The `handle_new_user` trigger function (SECURITY DEFINER) automatically creates a profile entry upon new user creation in `auth.users`.
- **Error Handling & Debugging:**
    - Addressed JavaScript syntax errors (e.g., TypeScript `as Error` in JS).
    - Resolved Supabase config parsing errors in `config.toml`.
    - Guided on deleting test users from Supabase Studio (Authentication tab or SQL Editor) to allow email reuse during testing.
    - Resolved Docker daemon connection issues by ensuring Docker Desktop was running.

---
**Key Context for Cascade (Future Sessions):**
-   **Authentication Entry Point:** `pages/login.vue` handles both parent login and signup.
-   **Supabase Client Access:** Use `const { $supabase } = useNuxtApp();` within Vue `setup` functions.
-   **Profile Data:** New user profile data (`full_name`, `username`, `role`) is passed via `signUp` options and handled by the `handle_new_user` SQL trigger. Changes to profile fields will require updating this trigger or the `profiles` table schema (`supabase/migrations/...create_profiles_table.sql`).
-   **Local Supabase Config:** Changes to auth behavior (redirects, email settings for local dev) are often managed in `supabase/config.toml`. Remember to `supabase stop` and `supabase start` for these to apply.
-   **Environment Variables:** `NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are critical and defined in `.env`.
-   **Key Files for Auth:**
    -   `pages/login.vue` (UI and core auth logic)
    -   `plugins/supabase.client.js` (Supabase client initialization)
    -   `supabase/config.toml` (Local Supabase service configuration)
    -   `supabase/migrations/*_create_profiles_table.sql` (Database schema for profiles and related triggers)
    -   `pages/please-confirm.vue` (Post-signup email confirmation instruction page)
    -   `pages/index.vue` (Root page, redirects to `/login`)

**Next Steps (Outstanding - related to Auth):**
-   Implement route protection/middleware for `/parent-dashboard` and other authenticated routes (e.g., using `onAuthStateChange` or a Nuxt middleware checking `supabase.auth.getUser()`).
-   Create the actual `/parent-dashboard` page content and functionality.
-   Design and implement Child login functionality (currently a placeholder in `login.vue`). This will likely require schema changes (e.g., PIN storage) and new RLS policies.
-   Further UI/UX refinements across the authentication flow.

## 4. Current State & Next Steps
- The core UI for parent and child task management is in place.
- Family member management and theme selection UIs are functional at a basic level.
- The testing suite has been significantly improved and is stable.

**Potential Next Steps:**
- **Data Persistence:** Transition from local mock data/state to a more robust solution (e.g., Vuex/Pinia for global state, or initial integration with Supabase if planned).
- **Family Settings - Full Functionality:**
    - Implement actual edit/delete functionality for family members.
    - Implement site-wide theme application based on selection in Family Settings.
- **Task Management Enhancements:**
    - More detailed task creation options (e.g., due dates, recurrence, points/rewards).
    - Filtering/sorting tasks.
- **Parent Dashboard - Advanced Features:**
    - Overview of all children's progress.
    - Notifications or alerts.
- **Error Handling & Edge Cases:** Review components and flows for robust error handling.
- **Accessibility (A11y) Review:** Ensure all components and interactions meet accessibility standards.
- **Further Refactoring:**
    - Review components for any further low-risk refactoring opportunities (e.g., composables for shared logic).
    - Ensure consistent coding patterns and styles across the project.

## 5. Known Issues/Warnings
- None critical. The previous Vue warning regarding missing props in `FamilyMemberItem.test.js` has been addressed by suppressing it for the specific test case.

This log provides a snapshot of the project's status for ongoing development.
