# Development Log - 2025-05-26

## Objective:
Fix loading issues on the login page and resolve errors related to Supabase integration, particularly in `family-settings.vue` and the overall Supabase client setup.

## Initial State:
- The `/login` page was hanging (stuck on a spinner).
- Errors indicated issues with `useSupabaseUser`, initially suspected in `family-settings.vue`.
- Terminal errors showed `[unimport] failed to find "useSupabaseUser"`.

## Summary of Work Done:

1.  **Simplified `login.vue`:**
    *   Temporarily commented out most of the `<script setup>` in `pages/login.vue` to isolate the page loading issue. This helped confirm the problem was likely external to the login page's immediate logic.

2.  **Addressed `family-settings.vue` (Initial Attempt):**
    *   Refactored `pages/family-settings.vue` to correctly call `useSupabaseUser` within a `setup()` method for Options API compatibility. While this was a correct change for that component, it didn't resolve the root "unimport" error.

3.  **Diagnosed and Fixed Supabase Module Configuration:**
    *   **Missing Module Registration:** Identified that `@nuxtjs/supabase` was not listed in the `modules` array in `nuxt.config.js`.
        *   **Action:** Added `'@nuxtjs/supabase'` to the `modules` array.
    *   **Missing Module Installation:** After registering the module, Nuxt reported it couldn't load `@nuxtjs/supabase` because it wasn't installed.
        *   **Action:** Ran `npm install @nuxtjs/supabase` to add the package.
    *   **Missing Module Initialization Config:** After installation, the `@nuxtjs/supabase` module itself threw an error because it couldn't find the Supabase URL and API key.
        *   **Action:** Added an explicit `supabase` configuration block to `nuxt.config.js`, pointing to `process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
        ```javascript
        // nuxt.config.js
        supabase: {
          url: process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
          key: process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
          redirectOptions: {
            login: '/login',
            callback: '/confirm',
            exclude: ['/','/signup'],
          }
        },
        ```

4.  **Resolved Client Provision Conflict:**
    *   Encountered a `TypeError: Cannot redefine property: $supabase`. This was because both the `@nuxtjs/supabase` module and the custom `plugins/supabase.client.js` were trying to provide `$supabase`.
    *   **Action:** Disabled the custom plugin by renaming it to `plugins/supabase.client.js.disabled`, allowing `@nuxtjs/supabase` to be the sole provider.

5.  **Restored `login.vue`:**
    *   After resolving the Supabase setup issues, the full script of `pages/login.vue` was uncommented and restored.

## Current Status:
- The `/login` page now loads correctly without hanging.
- The UI elements on the login page (user type selection, login/signup forms) are responsive.
- Supabase client initialization errors have been resolved.
- The application is ready for testing authentication flows.

## Next Steps (Upon Resuming):
1.  Test Parent Signup:
    *   Navigate to the signup form.
    *   Attempt to create a new parent account.
    *   Verify user creation in Supabase dashboard and email confirmation.
2.  Test Parent Login:
    *   Confirm email if required.
    *   Attempt to log in with the newly created parent account.
    *   Verify successful redirection to `/parent-dashboard`.
3.  Continue debugging any issues encountered during authentication testing.
4.  Proceed with fixing issues in `family-settings.vue` related to adding family members, now that the core Supabase user authentication is stable.
