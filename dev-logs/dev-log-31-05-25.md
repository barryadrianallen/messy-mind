# Dev Log - Messy Mind - 2025-05-31

## Objective:
Continue fixing and expanding Nuxt 3 Login Page Tests (`pages/login.vue` and `tests/pages/login.spec.js`).

## Progress Summary:

Today's session focused on resolving outstanding issues in the login page tests and expanding test coverage for UI interactions. All tests for `login.spec.js` (7 tests) are now passing, contributing to a total of 81 passing tests for the project.

### Key Changes and Fixes:

1.  **Corrected `data-testid` Attributes in Tests:**
    *   Updated `tests/pages/login.spec.js` to use the correct `data-testid` attributes for the initial user type selection buttons, aligning with `pages/login.vue`:
        *   `parent-button`
        *   `child-button`
        *   `create-parent-account-button`

2.  **Added `data-testid` Attributes to Component (`pages/login.vue`):**
    *   Added necessary `data-testid` attributes to various container elements and buttons to facilitate reliable testing:
        *   `user-type-selection` (for the initial view)
        *   `parent-login-form`
        *   `child-login-form`
        *   `parent-signup-form`
        *   `back-to-home-button-parent-login`
        *   `back-to-home-button-child-login`
        *   `back-to-home-button-parent-signup` (for the "Back" button on the signup form)

3.  **Resolved Vue Test Utils Warnings:**
    *   Stubbed `NuxtLink` (as `NuxtLink: true`) in the `global.stubs` configuration for all `mount` calls in `tests/pages/login.spec.js`. This resolved warnings about failing to resolve the `RouterLink` component.

4.  **Expanded Test Coverage for Navigation:**
    *   Added new test cases to `tests/pages/login.spec.js` to verify the functionality of the "Back to Home" / "Back" buttons on the parent login, child login, and parent signup forms. These tests ensure that clicking these buttons correctly navigates the user back to the initial user type selection view.

### Test Suite Status:
*   `tests/pages/login.spec.js`: 7 tests, all passing.
*   Project Total: 81 tests, all passing.

## Next Steps:
*   Investigate and fix issues with the **"Create Parent Account" form's submit button**, as it currently doesn't perform any action when clicked. This includes verifying the `handleSignup` function and related Supabase calls.
*   Decide on the next area of focus, such as:
    *   Testing other form submission handlers in `login.vue` (e.g., parent login, child login).
    *   Adding UI text assertions for `login.vue`.
    *   Working on tests for `family-settings.vue` or another component/page.
