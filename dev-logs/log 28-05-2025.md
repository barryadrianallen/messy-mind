### Session Summary with Cascade AI

**Initial State & Objectives:**
*   Started with failing tests in `AddMemberModal.test.js` (incorrect event emission data for child members).
*   `family-settings.test.js` was failing due to an unresolved `#imports` error, indicating a Vitest configuration issue with Nuxt 3 auto-imports.
*   Main goal: Get all tests passing and investigate application responsiveness.

**Test Fixes & Configuration:**
1.  **`AddMemberModal.test.js`:**
    *   Corrected the expected emitted data in the test for child member submission to include the `pin` field. Test now passes.
2.  **`family-settings.test.js` (`#imports` error):**
    *   Updated `vitest.config.js` to use `defineVitestConfig` from `@nuxt/test-utils/config`.
    *   Set `test.environment` to `'nuxt'` and configured `environmentOptions.nuxt.domEnvironment` to `'jsdom'`.
    *   Installed `@nuxt/test-utils` as a dev dependency.
3.  **Supabase Client Initialization in Tests:**
    *   After fixing `#imports`, tests started failing with "Supabase client URL and API key are required."
    *   User manually created `.env.test` with `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` (later confirmed these should be the actual variable names used by the Supabase client in the test env, not necessarily `NUXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed unless test setup specifically uses runtime config for them).
    *   Installed `dotenv` as a dev dependency.
    *   Updated `vitest.config.js` to import `dotenv` and call `dotenv.config({ path: '.env.test' })` to load test-specific environment variables.
4.  **Outcome:** All 12 test files (74 tests) are now passing.

**Application Responsiveness Issue:**
*   Despite all tests passing and the main `.env` file being correctly configured (verified `NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` as per `nuxt.config.js`), the application is unresponsive when running `npm run dev`.
*   No errors are reported in the browser console or the terminal.
*   User confirmed `.env` file was present and correct throughout; my earlier assumption it was missing (due to tool limitations) was incorrect.

**Current Status & Next Steps (for unresponsive app):**
*   User is tired and will pause debugging the unresponsive app.
*   A memory (ID: 006c7f5b-b9e0-4d54-8fbc-c21b2495a207) was created to resume debugging with the following steps:
    1.  Thoroughly inspect **Nuxt Devtools** (Plugins, Components, State, Pages, Status) for anomalies.
    2.  Perform a **basic Vue reactivity test** by adding a simple counter button to a layout/page.
    3.  Keep in mind a previous similar issue was resolved by `git fetch`.
