## Development Log - Session Ending 2025-05-24

**Objective:** Enhance Parent Dashboard with settings, implement Family Settings page including member management and theme selection.

**Key Features Implemented:**

1.  **Parent Dashboard - Settings Dropdown (`components/ParentDashboard.vue`):**
    *   Added a settings icon button in the header.
    *   Clicking the icon toggles a dropdown menu.
    *   Dropdown options (reordered):
        *   "Family Settings" (appears first)
        *   "Theme Settings"

2.  **Navigation to Settings Page:**
    *   "Family Settings" navigates to `/family-settings?tab=familyMembers`.
    *   "Theme Settings" navigates to `/family-settings?tab=themes`.

3.  **Family Settings Page (`pages/family-settings.vue`):**
    *   New page created to manage family and theme settings.
    *   Reads `tab` query parameter on mount to display the correct initial tab.
    *   **Header:** Includes a "Back" button and "Family Settings" title.
    *   **Tabs:** "Family Members" and "Themes".

    *   **Family Members Tab:**
        *   Displays a list of family members using the reusable `components/FamilyMemberItem.vue` component.
        *   "Add Member" button:
            *   Triggers the `components/AddMemberModal.vue`.
        *   **Add Member Modal (`components/AddMemberModal.vue`):**
            *   Allows adding new family members (Parent or Child).
            *   Fields: Full Name, Role (select), Username.
            *   "Age" field is conditionally displayed only if "Child" role is selected.
            *   New members are added to the local list in `family-settings.vue`.
        *   **Family Statistics Section:**
            *   Displays cards for "Children", "Parents", "Total Points", "Highest Level".
            *   Statistics dynamically update when members are added or deleted (from local list).

    *   **Themes Tab:**
        *   Displays a grid of selectable theme cards (e.g., Default, Calm Blue, Nature Green).
        *   Clicking a theme visually marks it as selected and logs the choice. Full theme application logic is pending.

**Key Files Created/Modified:**

*   `components/ParentDashboard.vue`: Added settings dropdown, reordered items, and updated navigation logic.
*   `pages/family-settings.vue`: New page for family and theme settings, tab handling, integration of member list and modal, dynamic statistics.
*   `components/FamilyMemberItem.vue`: New reusable component to display individual family members.
*   `components/AddMemberModal.vue`: New modal component for adding family members with conditional age field.

**Next Steps Considered (for future sessions):**
*   Persisting family member data (e.g., to a local JSON file).
*   Implementing full edit/delete functionality for family members.
*   Implementing site-wide application of selected themes.
